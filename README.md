## Description
    
This application allows users to track their most recent workouts. Users can start a new workout for today, then enter information for a resistance or cardio exercise. Users can also choose to continue today's workout and enter a new resistance or cardio exercise. Once an exercise has been entered for a worout, users will see information their most recent workout on the homepage, and can view their workout history in another tab.

In completing this project, in which I was tasked with developing the models, page routes and API routes for a NoSQL database (MongoDB) and Mongoose for ODM, I learned how to structure Mongoose models and queries, and use pre-written front-end code to guide development of routes and data handlers.
